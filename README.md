- 🌍 Currently, I’m a Data Scientist at Booking.com, where I help make smarter business decisions using experimentation and causal analysis, while developing machine learning models that run in production.  
- 🎓 My PhD at the University of Amsterdam focused on unraveling astrophysical phenomena with advanced statistical methods and computational modeling—think gamma-ray bursts and cutting-edge Bayesian techniques!  
- 🚀 Before diving into data science, I was an Embedded Developer in the space industry, designing software for CubeSat projects.  
- 💡 From space to data science, I thrive on tackling complex problems and delivering innovative solutions!
